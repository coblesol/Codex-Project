# Codex Project

This repository collects code samples, experiments, and lab exercises related to cybersecurity and secure software development. It is intended as a learning resource for professionals and students. For a focused set of exercises see [cybersecurity-lab/README.md](cybersecurity-lab/README.md).

## Example Usage

Running a sample analysis script:

```bash
$ python scripts/analyze.py data/example.log
Processing example.log...
Analysis complete. Results saved to results/example.json
```

Another common command generates a report:
